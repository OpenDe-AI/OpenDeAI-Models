🚀 OpenDeAI-Models

Decentralized AI Model Repository

📌 Overview

OpenDeAI-Models is an open-source, decentralized AI model repository where contributors can submit, refine, and share AI models. Our goal is to create a community-driven hub for AI models that anyone can use, improve, and decentralize—free from corporate control.

We welcome contributions in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and more.

💡 How to Use This Repository

1️⃣ Browse available AI models in the /models/ directory.
2️⃣ Download a model and integrate it into your application.
3️⃣ Improve existing models by submitting a pull request.
