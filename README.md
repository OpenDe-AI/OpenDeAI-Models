🚀 OpenDeAI-Models

A decentralized AI model repository for open collaboration and innovation in artificial intelligence.

📂 Repository Structure

This repository organizes AI models into three main categories:
	•	🗣️ NLP (Natural Language Processing)
Models related to text processing, sentiment analysis, chatbots, transformers, and more.
📍 Path: models/nlp/
	•	👀 Vision
Models focused on image recognition, object detection, segmentation, and related tasks.
📍 Path: models/vision/
	•	🤖 Reinforcement Learning
AI models for decision-making, gaming, robotics, and autonomous agents.
📍 Path: models/reinforcement-learning/

📥 Contributing a Model

Want to add your model? Follow these steps:
	1.	Create a new folder inside the relevant category (e.g., models/nlp/my-text-model/).
	2.	Include a MODEL_INFO.md file describing your model.
	3.	Submit an issue using the “Model Submission” template.
	4.	Open a Pull Request to propose your model addition.

📝 MODEL_INFO.md Template

Each model should have a MODEL_INFO.md with the following details:

# Model Name
- **Category:** (NLP, Vision, Reinforcement Learning)
- **Description:** (Brief overview of the model)
- **Dependencies:** (Any libraries or tools required)
- **Training Data:** (Dataset details)
- **Usage:** (Instructions on how to use it)
- **License:** (Specify if different from the repo license)
