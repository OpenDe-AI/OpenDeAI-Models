# Contributing to OpenDeAI-Models  

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenDeAI-Models! This repository is dedicated to the development, sharing, and improvement of decentralized AI models. Before contributing, please review the following guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.  

---

## 📌 **How to Contribute**  

### 1️⃣ Submitting a New AI Model  
To submit a new AI model, follow these steps:  
1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.  
2. Add your model under the `/models` directory in the correct category:  
   - `models/nlp/` (Natural Language Processing)  
   - `models/vision/` (Computer Vision)  
   - `models/reinforcement-learning/` (RL Models)  
3. Submit a **Model Submission Issue** before creating a pull request.  
4. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** with your model, linking to the issue.

For guidance, use the appropriate template:  
- 📄 [NLP Model Template](https://github.com/OpenDe-AI/OpenDeAI-Models/blob/main/models/nlp/MODEL_INFO.md)  
- 📄 [Vision Model Template](https://github.com/OpenDe-AI/OpenDeAI-Models/blob/main/models/vision/MODEL_INFO.md)  
- 📄 [Reinforcement Learning Model Template](https://github.com/OpenDe-AI/OpenDeAI-Models/blob/main/models/reinforcement-learning/MODEL_INFO.md)  

### 📌 Required Files  
Each model must include the following:  
✅ `model.py` – The core model file  
✅ `MODEL_INFO.md` – Use the correct template (linked above)  
✅ `requirements.txt` – List dependencies (if needed)  
✅ `example_inputs.txt` – Example inputs for testing (if applicable)  
---

### 2️⃣ Reporting Bugs or Issues  
If you encounter a bug, create an issue using the **Bug Report Template**, including:  
- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected vs. actual behavior  

---

### 3️⃣ Improving Existing Models  
If you want to optimize or fine-tune an existing model:  
1. Check the **Discussions** section for active improvements.  
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch for changes.  
3. Document your modifications in the model’s README.  
4. Submit a **Pull Request** with performance benchmarks.

---

## ✅ **Code Guidelines**  
- Use **Python** for AI models and training scripts.  
- Follow **PEP 8** for clean and readable code.  
- Use **Markdown** for documentation.  
- Ensure models are **well-documented** and reproducible.  

---

## 📜 **Licensing**  
- Models must include an open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL).  
- Ensure all datasets used comply with ethical and legal standards.  

---

## 🤝 **Community Guidelines**  
- Be respectful and collaborative.  
- No unauthorized dataset uploads or proprietary code submissions.  
- Use the **Discussions** section for general inquiries.
